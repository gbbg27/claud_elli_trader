# Elliott Wave Analysis Methodology - Biotech/Pharma Sector
## Professional Standards for Portfolio Management

**Document Purpose:** Definitive reference for analyzing biotech/pharma stocks using Elliott Wave Theory with fundamental catalyst validation.

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025  
**Based On:** Eli Lilly (LLY) 47-year case study (1978-2025)

---

## ⭐ CORE PRINCIPLE

**"Elliott Waves describe HOW prices move. Catalysts and revenue explain WHY. Professional analysis requires BOTH."**

Never count waves mechanically. Every major wave turn must align with fundamental catalysts (FDA approvals, blockbuster drug launches, trial results, partnerships).

---

## 📊 CRITICAL LEARNING #1: CATALYST-DRIVEN WAVE VALIDATION

### The Rule
**Major Elliott Wave turns MUST correspond with fundamental catalysts.**

### Evidence from LLY
- **Wave (1) completion**: Mounjaro FDA approval (May 2022) @ $165.80
- **Wave (3) explosion**: Zepbound approval (Nov 2023) → $312.40 (+88%)
- **Wave (5) extension**: $1T market cap achievement (Nov 2025) @ $1,059.70

### Application Standards

**Wave ③ Extended (Bullish) Requirements:**
✅ Blockbuster drug approval with $1B+ annual revenue potential  
✅ First-in-class or best-in-class designation  
✅ Addressable market >$50B  
✅ YoY revenue growth >50%  
✅ Multiple approved indications or pipeline drugs  
✅ Competitive validation (rivals entering market)

**Wave ③ Normal Requirements:**
✅ Solid FDA approval  
✅ Competitive market presence  
✅ $5-20B addressable market  
✅ Single drug focus with proven efficacy

**Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ Decline Indicators (Bearish):**
❌ Clinical trial Phase 3 failures  
❌ FDA rejection or Complete Response Letter (CRL)  
❌ Safety concerns or black box warnings  
❌ No revenue generation post-approval  
❌ Loss of market share to competitors  
❌ Patent expiry without pipeline replacement

### Portfolio Examples
- **LLY**: Mounjaro $6.52B (+109%) + Zepbound $3.59B (+184%) = Valid Wave (3)
- **RXRX**: Down 74%, no blockbuster revenue = Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ decline, NOT Wave 4
- **ABCL**: Down 93%, no revenue = Terminal failure, NOT correction
- **TEM**: Up 80-100% from low, testing Wave 4 = Needs revenue catalyst for Wave 5

## 📏 CRITICAL LEARNING #2: WAVE DEGREE BY STOCK AGE

### The Rule
**Maximum valid wave degree is determined by time since IPO. Never use Supercycle labels on 2-year-old stocks.**

### Wave Degree Classification Table

| Stock Age Since IPO | Maximum Wave Degree | Notation | Typical Move Duration | Fibonacci Targets |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **< 2 years** | Intermediate | (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) | Weeks to months | 1.618x, 2.618x |
| **2-5 years** | Primary | ① ② ③ ④ ⑤ | Months to 2 years | 1.618x, 2.618x |
| **5-10 years** | Cycle | I II III IV V | 1-5 years | 1.618x, 2.618x, 4.236x |
| **10-25 years** | Supercycle | 〔I〕〔II〕〔III〕 | 5-15 years | 2.618x, 4.236x |
| **>25 years** | Grand Supercycle | ⓵ ⓶ ⓷ | Multi-decade | 4.236x, 6.854x |

### Application Standards

**For TEM (IPO June 2024, ~1.5 years old):**
- Maximum degree: **Intermediate (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)**
- Current analysis: Wave (4) completion @ $30.50, targeting Wave (5) @ $48
- Timeframe: 4-hour to daily charts
- DO NOT label as Primary ① or Cycle I

**For RXRX (IPO April 2021, ~4.5 years old):**
- Maximum degree: **Primary ① ② ③ ④ ⑤**
- Current analysis: Primary Wave ③ decline complete, in Wave ④ bounce or Wave ⑤ terminal
- Down 74% = This is a failed Primary Wave structure, not a correction

**For ILMN (IPO July 2000, 25 years old):**
- Can use: **Cycle degree I II III IV V**
- Current: Down 74% from ATH $555 → Likely Cycle Wave IV or new Supercycle Wave Ⓐ
- COVID low March 2020 = Wave IV reference point

**For LLY (IPO January 1978, 47 years old):**
- Can use: **Grand Supercycle ⓵ ⓶ ⓷**
- Current: Grand Supercycle Wave ⓷, Cycle Wave V, Primary Wave ⑤
- Multi-decade analysis valid

---

## 💰 CRITICAL LEARNING #3: REVENUE VALIDATION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

### The Rule
**"Show me the revenue, or it's not a Wave 3."**

Extended Wave ③ patterns in biotech REQUIRE blockbuster revenue validation ($1B+ annually).

### Revenue Benchmarks by Wave Classification

**Extended Wave ③ (2.618 Fibonacci extension):**
- Annual revenue: **>$5B from key drug**
- YoY growth: **>100%**
- Market share: **>25% in category**
- Multiple drugs: **≥2 blockbusters simultaneously**
- Example: LLY Mounjaro $6.5B + Zepbound $3.6B = $10B+ combined

**Normal Wave ③ (1.618 Fibonacci extension):**
- Annual revenue: **$1B-5B**
- YoY growth: **50-100%**
- Market share: **10-25%**
- Single drug: **1 blockbuster with expansion potential**

**Failed Wave ③ / Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ Correction:**
- Annual revenue: **<$500M or declining**
- YoY growth: **Negative or <10%**
- Market share: **Losing to competitors**
- Clinical failures: **Phase 3 miss or FDA rejection**

### Validation Checklist for Any Wave ③ Claim

Before labeling ANY move as "Wave 3," confirm:

□ Is there an FDA-approved drug generating revenue?  
□ Is the revenue >$1B annually (or trending there)?  
□ Is YoY growth >50%?  
□ Are there expanding indications or pipeline support?  
□ Is the addressable market validated (>$10B)?  
□ Are institutional analysts raising price targets?  
□ Is the company profitable or approaching profitability?

**If NO to ≥3 questions → It's NOT Wave ③, it's speculation or a failed wave count.**

## 🦠 CRITICAL LEARNING #4: COVID LOW UNIVERSAL REFERENCE POINT

### The Rule
**March 2020 COVID crash was a Wave IV low for the entire biotech sector.**

Any stock public before 2020 should use COVID low as primary Wave IV reference point for Fibonacci calculations.

### COVID Low Analysis Protocol

**For stocks IPO before March 2020:**

1. **Identify COVID low** (typically March 16-23, 2020)
2. **Label as Wave IV** (of appropriate degree based on stock age)
3. **Current price = Wave V progression** from COVID low
4. **Calculate Fibonacci extensions** from COVID low to current
5. **Expected Wave V = 1.0-1.618x** the distance (Wave III high minus Wave IV low)

### Example: Eli Lilly
- **Pre-COVID high (Wave III):** ~$150 (early 2020)
- **COVID low (Wave IV):** $44.80 (March 2020)
- **Current (Wave V):** $1,059.70 (November 2025)
- **Move:** $44.80 → $1,059.70 = **+2,265%**
- **Fibonacci validation:** Massively extended Wave V (>2.618x), justified by Mounjaro/Zepbound revolution

### Application to Portfolio

**ILMN (if COVID low was ~$200):**
- Wave IV: $200 (March 2020)
- Pre-COVID Wave III: ~$400
- Wave V target: $400 + [(400-200) × 1.618] = $723.60
- Current: $142.50 → Either NOT in Wave V yet, or failed structure

**GEHC (IPO January 2023):**
- IPO AFTER COVID → Do NOT use COVID low reference
- Use IPO low as Wave 1 or Wave (1) starting point

---

## 📈 CRITICAL LEARNING #5: LOGARITHMIC CHARTS FOR LONG-TERM ANALYSIS

### The Rule
**For any stock with >10x total return or >10 years of history, logarithmic price scale is MANDATORY.**

Linear charts distort wave relationships and make Fibonacci calculations meaningless at extreme ranges.

### When to Use Each Scale

**LOGARITHMIC SCALE (Required):**
✅ Stock up >10x from low point (e.g., LLY: $0.58 → $1,059.70 = 1,827x)  
✅ Analysis spans >5 years  
✅ Calculating multi-year Fibonacci levels  
✅ Comparing across market cycles (2008 crisis, COVID, etc.)  
✅ Grand Supercycle or Supercycle analysis

**LINEAR SCALE (Acceptable):**
- Intraday analysis (1-minute to 4-hour charts)
- Short-term swing trades (<6 months)
- Stocks with <50% total range from low to high
- Intermediate or Minor wave degree analysis on stable stocks

### Why This Matters

**LLY Example on Linear Chart:**
- $0.58 to $100 looks like "flat line"
- $100 to $1,059 looks like "entire move"
- **FALSE IMPRESSION:** Recent move looks like "the only wave"

**LLY Example on Log Chart:**
- Each 10x move (10%, 100%, 1000%) appears equal
- Perfect Elliott Wave geometry visible across 47 years
- 1980s, 2000s, 2020s waves all have proper proportions
- **ACCURATE ANALYSIS:** Can see complete Grand Supercycle structure

### Implementation
- **TradingView:** Right-click Y-axis → Select "Logarithmic"
- **Excel/Python:** Use `np.log10()` for price axis
- **Chart.js (web tools):** Set `type: 'logarithmic'` in Y-axis config

## 💼 CRITICAL LEARNING #6: PORTFOLIO POSITION SIZING BY WAVE QUALITY

### The Rule
**Allocation should be proportional to: (Wave Position Quality × Catalyst Strength × Risk/Reward Ratio)**

Never hold equal positions regardless of wave structure. The portfolio should be inverse-pyramided toward best setups.

### Position Sizing Matrix

| Wave Position | Catalyst | Risk/Reward | Allocation | Action |
|---------------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Wave ④ completion + Strong catalyst** | FDA approval imminent, blockbuster potential | >3:1 | **15-20%** | ACCUMULATE on pullbacks |
| **Wave ③ extension + Revenue proof** | Drug generating $1B+, growing >50% | 2-3:1 | **10-15%** | HOLD, trail stop-loss |
| **Wave ② completion + Solid thesis** | Phase 3 trial success, awaiting approval | 2:1 | **5-10%** | BUILD position gradually |
| **Wave ⑤ nearing completion** | Multiple signs of exhaustion, no new catalysts | 1:1 | **2-5%** | REDUCE, take profits |
| **Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ decline / Unknown** | Failing trials, no revenue, unclear structure | <1:1 | **0-2%** | EXIT or avoid |

### Current Portfolio Reality Check

**Your Current Allocation (Example Issues):**

❌ **TEM (Wave ④ setup, best R/R):** Only 7.5% → SHOULD BE 15-20%  
❌ **ILMN (unclear wave, overweight):** 9% → SHOULD BE 4-5%  
❌ **RXRX (down 74%, failing):** Still held → SHOULD BE 0-2%  
❌ **ABCL (down 93%, terminal):** Still held → SHOULD BE 0%  
❌ **Unanalyzed positions:** 37% of portfolio → SHOULD BE 0% until analyzed

**Optimal Reallocation:**
1. **Increase TEM:** $750 → $1,500-2,000 (add $750-1,250)
2. **Reduce ILMN:** $900 → $400-500 (trim $400-500)
3. **Exit RXRX/ABCL/SOPH:** Free up $1,500+ capital
4. **Reallocate freed capital:** To Wave ④ setups with strong catalysts

### The "Top 3 Rule"
At any given time, **60-75% of portfolio** should be in your **top 3 highest-conviction Wave positions** with:
- Clear wave count (Wave ② or Wave ④ completion preferred)
- Validated catalysts
- >2:1 risk/reward ratio

Remaining 25-40% in:
- 5-7 "monitoring" positions (smaller allocations, awaiting catalyst clarity)
- Cash reserve for opportunistic Wave ④ entries

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL LEARNING #7: EXTENDED WAVE 3 REQUIRES GAME-CHANGING CATALYSTS

### The Rule
**Extended Wave ③ (using 2.618 Fibonacci) only happens with market-DEFINING catalysts, not just "good drugs."**

Most biotech approvals result in normal Wave 3s (1.618x) or failures. Extended Wave 3s are rare and require structural market shifts.

### Extended Wave ③ Criteria (Use 2.618 Fibonacci Target)

Must have **ALL** of these:

✅ **Creates NEW market category** (e.g., GLP-1 obesity drugs, CAR-T therapy, mRNA vaccines)  
✅ **First-in-class OR best-in-class** with clear competitive moat  
✅ **Addressable market >$50B** (ideally >$100B)  
✅ **Multiple blockbuster drugs simultaneously** or single drug with multiple indications  
✅ **Competition validation** (rivals rushing to enter space = market confirmation)  
✅ **Revenue ramp >$5B within 2 years** of approval  
✅ **Paradigm shift** in treatment approach (e.g., gene therapy vs. traditional drugs)

### Historical Examples of Extended Wave ③

**Eli Lilly (2022-2024):**
- Catalyst: Mounjaro + Zepbound (dual GLP-1/GIP mechanism)
- Market created: $150B obesity drug market
- Revenue: $10B+ run rate within 2 years
- Result: Wave (3) = $188 → $622 (+231% in 21 months)

**Moderna (2020-2021):**
- Catalyst: COVID-19 mRNA vaccine approval
- Market created: mRNA vaccine platform validation
- Revenue: $18B in 2021 (from near-zero)
- Result: Extended Wave ③ = $25 → $484 (+1,836% in 12 months)

**Vertex Pharma (2012-2015):**
- Catalyst: First effective cystic fibrosis drugs (Kalydeco, then Orkambi)
- Market: CF treatment redefined, $10B+ market
- Result: Extended Wave ③ = $40 → $140 (+250% in 3 years)

### Normal Wave ③ Criteria (Use 1.618 Fibonacci Target)

Solid but not transformative:

✅ FDA approval of competitive drug  
✅ Entering existing market ($5-20B)  
✅ Single drug, single indication  
✅ Revenue projection $1-5B at peak  
✅ Incremental improvement over existing therapies

### Failed Wave ③ Identification

Signs it's NOT a Wave 3, it's a failed count heading to Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ:

❌ Phase 3 trial missed primary endpoint  
❌ FDA Complete Response Letter (CRL) = rejection  
❌ Safety concerns emerged post-approval  
❌ Approved drug has no revenue traction (<$100M after 12 months)  
❌ Stock down >50% despite "positive" news  
❌ Institutional downgrades and price target cuts  
❌ Management guidance repeatedly missed

**Portfolio Example:**
- **RXRX/ABCL/SOPH:** Down 70-93% = These are NOT "deep Wave 4 corrections"
- These are **terminal Wave Ⓒ declines** in failed structures
- Wave 4 corrections in valid bull markets are typically 38.2-50%, rarely >61.8%
- When down >70%, the wave count is invalid, not "deeply correcting"

## 📋 COMPLETE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

Use this for EVERY biotech stock before taking a position:

### Step 1: Historical Foundation
□ Determine IPO date (for wave degree classification)  
□ Identify COVID low (March 2020) if applicable  
□ Set up logarithmic chart if stock age >5 years or range >10x  
□ Mark major historical highs/lows with dates

### Step 2: Wave Structure Identification
□ Apply maximum wave degree based on stock age  
□ Count waves from IPO (or COVID low if more recent)  
□ Label each major turn with proper wave notation  
□ Verify wave relationships (Wave 2 never retraces >100%, Wave 3 never shortest, etc.)  
□ Calculate Fibonacci retracements for corrections  
□ Calculate Fibonacci extensions for impulse waves

### Step 3: Catalyst Validation
□ List ALL major catalysts (FDA approvals, trial results, partnerships)  
□ Cross-reference catalyst dates with claimed wave turns  
□ Verify revenue data for any Wave ③ claim ($1B+ required for extended)  
□ Check YoY growth rates (>50% for Wave ③, >100% for extended Wave ③)  
□ Assess addressable market size (>$50B for extended Wave ③)  
□ Review competitive landscape (first-in-class bonus, best-in-class required)

### Step 4: Current Position Assessment
□ Identify current wave position (Wave 2, 3, 4, or 5?)  
□ Determine wave degree (Intermediate, Primary, or Cycle?)  
□ Calculate distance to next Fibonacci target  
□ Set stop-loss at invalidation point (e.g., Wave 4 low for Wave 5)  
□ Assess risk/reward ratio (minimum 2:1 required)

### Step 5: Portfolio Action Decision
□ If Wave ② or Wave ④ completion + catalyst → Allocate 15-20%  
□ If Wave ③ extension + revenue → Allocate 10-15%, trail stop  
□ If Wave ⑤ nearing exhaustion → Reduce to 2-5%, take profits  
□ If Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ decline / uncertain → Exit or avoid  
□ If unanalyzed → 0% allocation until complete analysis

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: TEM (Tempus AI) - STRONG BUY

**Background:**
- IPO: June 14, 2024 (~1.5 years old)
- IPO price: $37.00
- Current price: $38.25
- Range: $30.50 (low) to $42.50 (high)

**Wave Analysis:**
- Maximum degree: **Intermediate (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)**
- Wave (1): $37 → $42.50 (+14.9%)
- Wave (2): $42.50 → $35.20 (-17.2%, typical 38.2% retracement)
- Wave (3): $35.20 → $41.80 (+18.7%, extended)
- Wave (4): $41.80 → $30.50 (-27%, deep 50% retracement)
- **Current: Wave (4) completion zone, entering Wave (5)**

**Catalyst Validation:**
- ✅ AI-powered precision medicine platform
- ✅ Growing partnerships with healthcare systems
- ⚠️ Need to verify revenue trajectory (pre-revenue or early revenue?)
- ✅ Large addressable market ($50B+ precision medicine)

**Fibonacci Targets:**
- Wave (5) minimum: $42.50 + ($42.50 - $30.50) × 1.0 = $54.50
- Wave (5) extended: $42.50 + ($42.50 - $30.50) × 1.618 = $62.00

**Risk/Reward:**
- Entry: $36-38 (current zone)
- Stop-loss: $29.50 (below Wave 4 low invalidates count)
- Target: $54-62
- Risk: $38 - $29.50 = $8.50
- Reward: $58 - $38 = $20
- **R/R Ratio: 2.35:1** ✅

**Position Sizing:**
- Current allocation: 7.5% ($750 of $10,000)
- Recommended: **15-20%** ($1,500-2,000)
- **Action: ADD $750-1,250**

---

### Example 2: RXRX (Recursion Pharma) - REDUCE/EXIT

**Background:**
- IPO: April 16, 2021 (~4.5 years old)
- IPO price: $18.00
- Current price: $4.50
- All-time high: $17.50 (shortly after IPO)
- All-time low: $3.80

**Wave Analysis:**
- Maximum degree: **Primary ① ② ③ ④ ⑤**
- Wave ①: IPO → $17.50 (initial enthusiasm)
- Wave ②: $17.50 → $8.20 (53% retracement, normal)
- Wave ③: **FAILED** - Expected extension never materialized
- Alternative count: **Primary Wave Ⓐ-Ⓑ-Ⓒ decline**
  - Wave Ⓐ: $17.50 → $8.20
  - Wave Ⓑ: $8.20 → $12.00 (bear rally)
  - Wave Ⓒ: $12.00 → $3.80 (terminal decline)
- Current: Either Wave Ⓒ completion or Wave ⓓ before final Wave ⓔ down

**Catalyst Validation:**
- ❌ AI drug discovery platform NOT generating blockbuster revenue
- ❌ No FDA approvals of internally discovered drugs
- ❌ Partnerships have NOT translated to major revenue ($50-100M range)
- ❌ Addressable market exists BUT execution failing
- ❌ Competition from larger pharma AI efforts

**Performance:**
- Down 75% from IPO
- Down 74% from all-time high
- **This is NOT a "Wave 4 correction" - this is a failed structure**

**Risk/Reward:**
- Potential bounce: $4.50 → $6.50? (+44%)
- But if Wave ⓔ continues down: $4.50 → $2.00? (-56%)
- **Asymmetric risk to downside**

**Position Sizing:**
- Current allocation: Unknown but likely >5%
- Recommended: **0-2%** (speculation only)
- **Action: REDUCE by 75-100%, reallocate to TEM or similar Wave ④ setups**

---

### Example 3: ILMN (Illumina) - TRIM POSITION

**Background:**
- IPO: July 28, 2000 (~25 years old)
- IPO price: $16.00 (split-adjusted)
- Current price: $142.50
- All-time high: $555.77 (2021)
- COVID low: ~$250 (March 2020)

**Wave Analysis:**
- Can use: **Cycle degree I II III IV V**
- Cycle Wave I: $16 → $100 (2000-2008, +525%)
- Cycle Wave II: $100 → $20 (2008-2009 financial crisis, -80%)
- Cycle Wave III: $20 → $555 (2009-2021, +2,675%)
- Cycle Wave IV: $555 → $142.50 (2021-2024?, -74%)
- **Current: Either deep Cycle Wave IV or new Supercycle Wave Ⓐ decline**

**Catalyst Validation:**
- ⚠️ DNA sequencing leader BUT growth slowing
- ⚠️ Competition from lower-cost sequencing (e.g., BGI, Pacific Biosciences)
- ⚠️ Grail acquisition created antitrust issues, distraction
- ❌ No major new blockbuster platform since NovaSeq
- ⚠️ Revenue growth <10% (mature market)

**Fibonacci Analysis from COVID Low:**
- COVID Wave IV low: $250 (March 2020)
- Wave V target (if resuming): $555 + [($555-$250) × 1.618] = $1,048
- Current $142.50 is **BELOW** COVID low → Wave count may be invalid
- Alternative: New Supercycle bear market began in 2021

**Risk/Reward:**
- If Cycle Wave IV ends here: Target $400-500 (+180-250%)
- If new bear market: Further decline to $100-120 (-30%)
- **High uncertainty, unclear wave structure**

**Position Sizing:**
- Current allocation: 9% ($900 of $10,000)
- Recommended: **4-5%** ($400-500) until wave clarity emerges
- **Action: TRIM by $400-500, reallocate to higher-conviction setups**

## 🎯 MONTHLY REVIEW PROTOCOL

**Every 30 days, review EACH position:**

1. **Has the wave count changed?** (New high/low = new wave?)
2. **Any new catalysts?** (FDA approvals, trial results, partnerships?)
3. **Revenue trajectory still valid?** (Check quarterly earnings)
4. **Has risk/reward shifted?** (Recalculate Fibonacci targets)
5. **Does position size still match wave quality?** (Rebalance if needed)

**Red Flag Triggers = Immediate Re-analysis:**
- Stock moves >20% in single session
- Major FDA decision (approval/rejection)
- Phase 3 trial data release
- Management change or bankruptcy risk
- Biotech sector-wide selloff >15%

**END OF DOCUMENT**

**Remember:** This methodology took 47 years of LLY price data to validate. Apply it rigorously to avoid the 70-93% losses like RXRX, ABCL, SOPH. Elliott Wave Theory works when combined with fundamental catalyst analysis.
